## Use Cases Identified

### Use Case 1: Cancer Fusion Detection (HIGHEST PRIORITY) - ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Priority**: P0

**Target Audience**: Cancer researchers, oncologists, clinical genomics labs

**Biological Question**: Which fusion genes are driving tumor growth and could be therapeutic targets?

**Key Applications**:
- Identify actionable fusions (ALK, ROS1, RET, NTRK, FGFR)
- Match patients to FDA-approved targeted therapies
- Discover novel fusions in understudied cancers
- Confirm diagnostic fusions (e.g., EWS-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma)

**Why Highest Priority**:
1. Broadest applicability across multiple cancer types
2. Directly informs treatment decisions (precision oncology)
3. Well-established clinical use case
4. Test data readily available
5. High impact on patient outcomes

**Cancer Types Covered**:
- Lung cancer (NSCLC): ALK, ROS1, RET fusions
- Prostate cancer: TMPRSS2-ERG fusion
- Breast cancer: FGFR fusions
- Sarcomas: EWS-FLI1, SS18-SSX fusions
- Thyroid cancer: RET/PTC fusions
- Gliomas: FGFR-TACC, BRAF fusions

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- Directory: `/Users/david/git/prod_apps/nextflow/rnafusion/cancer-fusion-detection/`
- App name: `rnafusion-cancer-detection`
- Files: app.json, test_samplesheet.csv, README.md, TESTING_LOG.md, STATUS.txt

---

### Use Case 2: Translocation Validation (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Priority**: P1

**Target Audience**: Clinical cytogenetics labs, molecular pathologists

**Biological Question**: Does the chromosomal translocation detected by karyotyping/FISH result in an expressed fusion transcript?

**Key Applications**:
- Validate DNA-level translocations at RNA level
- Confirm fusion transcript expression
- Identify exact breakpoint in cDNA
- Assess expression levels

**Why Secondary Priority**:
- More specialized than cancer fusion detection
- Smaller target audience (validation rather than discovery)
- Can leverage infrastructure from Use Case 1

**Implementation Status**: üî≤ Not Started

---

### Use Case 3: Leukemia and Lymphoma Fusion Profiling (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Priority**: P1

**Target Audience**: Hematologic oncology researchers, leukemia/lymphoma diagnostic labs

**Biological Question**: Which fusion genes define this leukemia subtype and predict prognosis?

**Key Fusions**:
- AML: PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, MLL rearrangements
- ALL: BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1
- CML: BCR-ABL1
- Lymphomas: NPM1-ALK, IGH fusions

**Key Applications**:
- Rapid molecular diagnosis
- Prognostic stratification
- Minimal residual disease monitoring
- Identify rare/novel fusions

**Why Secondary Priority**:
- Important but narrower audience (hematologic malignancies only)
- Can leverage infrastructure from Use Case 1
- Specialized to blood cancers

**Implementation Status**: üî≤ Not Started

## Lessons Learned

### Pipeline-Specific Insights

1. **GRCh38 Only**: rnafusion only supports human GRCh38/hg38
   - No GRCh37/hg19 support
   - No other organism support
   - Human-specific fusion databases built-in

2. **Multiple Fusion Callers**: Strength of pipeline is consensus calling
   - STAR-Fusion: Fast, accurate
   - arriba: High sensitivity, great visualization
   - FusionCatcher: Comprehensive, clinical-grade
   - All three enabled for maximum confidence

3. **Paired-End Preferred**: While single-end works, paired-end strongly recommended
   - Better fusion breakpoint detection
   - Higher sensitivity for rare fusions

4. **Test Data Available**: nf-core maintains official test data
   - Branch: rnafusion in test-datasets repository
   - Small test files for rapid validation
   - Same data used in pipeline CI/CD

### Implementation Best Practices

1. **Biology-First Approach**: Documentation focuses on biological questions
   - What are gene fusions?
   - Which fusions are actionable?
   - How to interpret results?
   - Clinical applications clear

2. **Comprehensive Content**: App.json includes extensive HTML content
   - 3000+ words of biological context
   - Clinically actionable fusions listed
   - Cancer-specific examples
   - Result interpretation guidelines

3. **Test Data Verification**: Always verify test data before implementing
   - Check nf-core/test-datasets for branch
   - Validate URLs are accessible
   - Confirm format matches requirements

4. **Node Size Strategy**: Start small, scale up as needed
   - XSMALL for testing (fast, cheap)
   - Document expected resource requirements
   - Provide multiple size options

5. **Documentation is Key**: Comprehensive docs enable others to test/use
   - README.md for users
   - TESTING_LOG.md for developers
   - USE_CASES.md for context
   - STATUS.txt for quick status

### Development Process Insights

1. **Follow the Plan**: PIPELINE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md provides excellent structure
   - Research ‚Üí Document ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test
   - Use case prioritization works well
   - Maximum 5 attempts prevents infinite loops

2. **Use Templates**: Starting from working examples accelerates development
   - Looked at chipseq for app.json structure
   - Followed NODE_SIZE_GUIDANCE.md recommendations
   - Used QUICK_START.md workflow

3. **Test Data First**: Finding test data before implementation prevents issues
   - Confirms pipeline is testable
   - Provides realistic examples
   - Validates parameter requirements

4. **Document Everything**: Future users/developers benefit from detailed notes
   - Common issues and fixes
   - Why certain decisions were made
   - Expected outcomes

## Recommendations for Future Implementation

### For Completing rnafusion

1. **Test cancer-fusion-detection first**

### For Other Pipelines

1. **Follow this pattern**:
   - Research biological use cases first
   - Document in USE_CASES.md before implementing

   - Review pipeline's test.config for examples
   - Consult pipeline documentation on nf-co.re
   - Check GitHub issues for common problems

3. **Biology-focused documentation**:
   - Write for biologists, not bioinformaticians
   - Explain biological questions addressed
   - Provide interpretation guidelines
   - List clinical/research applications

4. **Comprehensive testing documentation**:
