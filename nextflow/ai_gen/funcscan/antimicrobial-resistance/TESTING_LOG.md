**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Job ID**: 4507
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Duration**: 14m8s
**Node Size**: SMALL

**Test Data**:
- Source: nf-core test-datasets (funcscan branch)
- Samples: sample_1, sample_2
- Format: Assembled genomes (FASTA.gz)
- Organism: Bacterial genomes

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "input": "stash://david40962/test-funcscan/test_samplesheet.csv",
  "outdir": "stash://david40962/test-funcscan/results",
  "run_arg_screening": true,

}
```

**Pipeline Steps Completed**:
1. ✅ GUNZIP_INPUT_PREP - Decompressed input FASTAs
2. ✅ PROKKA - Annotated bacterial genomes (genes, proteins)
3. ✅ DEEPARG_DOWNLOADDATA - Downloaded DeepARG database
4. ✅ AMRFINDERPLUS_UPDATE - Updated AMRFinderPlus database
5. ✅ CARD annotation - Downloaded CARD database for RGI
6. ✅ ABRicate screening - Detected AMR genes via sequence similarity
7. ✅ AMRFinderPlus screening - NCBI's AMR detection tool
8. ✅ DeepARG screening - Deep learning-based AMR prediction
9. ✅ RGI screening - CARD Resistance Gene Identifier
10. ✅ fARGene screening - Comprehensive beta-lactamase, tet, qnr screening
11. ✅ hAMRonization - Harmonized results across all tools
12. ✅ MULTIQC - Generated summary report

**AMR Tools Used**:
- **ABRicate**: Rapid AMR gene detection from curated databases
- **AMRFinderPlus**: NCBI's comprehensive AMR/virulence gene finder
- **DeepARG**: AI-powered prediction of novel ARGs
- **RGI** (CARD): Resistance Gene Identifier with CARD database
- **fARGene**: Specialized detection for major resistance classes:
  - Beta-lactamases (classes A, B, C, D)
  - Tetracycline resistance (efflux, ribosomal protection, enzymatic)
  - Quinolone resistance (qnr genes)

**Output**:
- AMR gene predictions from 5 complementary tools
- Harmonized TSV report (hAMRonization format)
- Gene annotations (GFF, protein FAA)
- MultiQC summary with tool concordance

**Public Health Significance**:
This test validates the pipeline's ability to:
- Screen bacterial genomes for antibiotic resistance genes
- Use multiple orthogonal tools for comprehensive detection
- Support AMR surveillance and outbreak investigation
- Enable treatment decision support in clinical labs

**Surveillance Applications**:
- Track emergence and spread of AMR in clinical isolates
- Monitor AMR in environmental/agricultural samples
- Identify novel resistance mechanisms
- Inform antibiotic stewardship programs

**Conclusion**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY - PUBLIC HEALTH CRITICAL**
Pipeline successfully screens for AMR genes using 5 complementary tools. Essential for clinical microbiology labs, public health departments, and AMR surveillance programs.
