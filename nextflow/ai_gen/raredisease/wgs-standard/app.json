  "content": "<h1>Rare Disease Diagnosis: Whole Genome Analysis</h1><h2>What This Analysis Does</h2><p>This analysis searches your patient's entire genome to find genetic variants that could be causing their rare disease. Unlike targeted tests that look at specific genes, whole genome sequencing examines all 3 billion letters of DNA to identify disease-causing mutations. This comprehensive approach is particularly powerful for undiagnosed genetic conditions where the causative gene is unknown.</p><p>The analysis detects multiple types of genetic changes: single letter changes (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels), large structural rearrangements (SVs), and changes in gene copy numbers (CNVs). Each variant is annotated with information about its potential to cause disease, helping clinicians prioritize which genetic changes to investigate further.</p><h2>When To Use This</h2><ul><li><strong>Undiagnosed Genetic Disease:</strong> Patient with clinical features suggesting a genetic condition but no diagnosis after standard testing</li><li><strong>Complex Phenotypes:</strong> Multi-system disorders that don't fit a single gene or known syndrome</li><li><strong>Negative Panel Testing:</strong> Previous gene panels or exome sequencing failed to identify a cause</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Variant Detection:</strong> Need to detect all variant types including structural variants and CNVs</li><li><strong>Research and Gene Discovery:</strong> Investigating novel disease genes or mechanisms</li><li><strong>Precision Medicine:</strong> Identifying actionable variants for targeted therapies</li></ul><h2>What You Need</h2><h3>1. Whole Genome Sequencing Data (FASTQ Files)</h3><p>You need paired-end Illumina sequencing files from your patient's DNA sample:</p><ul><li><strong>Sample source:</strong> Blood, saliva, or tissue DNA from patient (and optionally parents for trio analysis)</li><li><strong>File format:</strong> Paired FASTQ files (typically *_R1.fastq.gz and *_R2.fastq.gz)</li><li><strong>Sequencing depth:</strong> Minimum 30x coverage recommended, 40-50x optimal for clinical diagnosis</li><li><strong>Read length:</strong> 150bp paired-end reads (standard Illumina)</li><li><strong>Platform:</strong> Illumina HiSeq, NovaSeq, or equivalent</li></ul><h3>2.

The pipeline processes samples in parallel when possible to optimize runtime.</em></p><h2>Scientific Background</h2><p>This analysis uses the nf-core/raredisease pipeline, a best-practice workflow developed from clinical diagnostic experience analyzing thousands of rare disease patients. The pipeline uses DeepVariant, an AI-based variant caller developed by Google that achieves high accuracy through deep learning. Structural variants are detected with Manta, and variants are annotated using the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) with CADD pathogenicity scores. This combination of tools represents current best practices in clinical rare disease diagnostics and has demonstrated ~40% diagnostic yield in production healthcare settings.</p><p>The pipeline follows the workflow used in the Stockholm region of Sweden for clinical diagnostics, analyzing nearly 3,000 whole genomes and 1,000 exomes annually. It implements quality control standards appropriate for clinical use and provides ranked variant outputs optimized for clinical interpretation.</p><h2>Clinical Considerations</h2><p><strong>Diagnostic Yield:</strong> Whole genome sequencing achieves approximately 40% diagnostic rate for rare genetic diseases in clinical practice. Success is highest when:</p><ul><li>Clinical phenotype is well-characterized</li><li>Disease has a genetic basis (familial clustering or known genetic causes)</li><li>High quality, high coverage sequencing data is available</li><li>Parental samples available for inheritance pattern analysis (trio analysis)</li></ul><p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Results should be interpreted by qualified clinical geneticists or genetic counselors in the context of the patient's clinical presentation. Not all detected variants are disease-causing, and clinical correlation is essential.</p><p><strong>Incidental Findings:</strong> Genome-wide analysis may identify medically actionable variants unrelated to the primary indication. Consider institutional policies for reporting secondary findings.</p><h2>Data Requirements and Costs</h2><p><strong>Sequencing Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>WGS generates approximately 100-150 GB of raw data per sample at 30x coverage</li><li>Higher coverage (50x) produces proportionally more data but improves variant detection sensitivity</li><li>Ensure adequate storage for both raw FASTQ files and analysis outputs</li></ul><p><strong>Computational Resources:</strong></p><ul><li>Analysis requires substantial computational resources (64+ CPU cores, 360+ GB RAM)</li><li>Default node size: XSMALL (suitable for test data)</li><li>Recommended for production: LARGE or XLARGE for optimal performance</li></ul><h2>Getting Started</h2><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Ensure your whole genome sequencing data meets quality standards (30x+ coverage, Q30+ quality scores)</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create your samplesheet CSV file with sample information, following the format above exactly</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Upload your FASTQ files and samplesheet to Camber stash storage</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Run this analysis, providing your samplesheet and choosing the appropriate reference genome</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Review the MultiQC report first to verify data quality, then examine ranked variant lists</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Work with clinical genetics team to interpret candidate variants in clinical context</p><p><a href='https://nf-co.re/raredisease' target='_blank'>Advanced users: See full pipeline documentation</a></p>",
