Status: üìù Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing
App: smrnaseq-novel-discovery
Last Updated: 2025-09-30

Configuration:
- Command: nextflow run nf-core/smrnaseq --input ${input} --outdir ${outdir} --genome ${genome} --mirtrace_species ${species} --skip_mirdeep false -r 2.4.0
- Parameters: 4 (input, outdir, genome, species)
- Special: MIRDeep2 enabled for novel miRNA discovery
- Version: 2.4.0
- Use Case: Discover novel, unannotated miRNAs

Biology:
- Target: Novel miRNAs in non-model organisms, cancer, specialized tissues
- Users: Non-model organism researchers, cancer biologists, evolutionary biologists
- Application: Computational discovery requiring experimental validation

Testing Status:
- Implementation: Complete
- Test data: nf-core test-datasets available
- Expected runtime: 30-60 minutes (computationally intensive)
- Note: Human test data may not yield many novel discoveries (well-annotated)
- Ready for: First test attempt

Next Steps:
1. Upload test samplesheet
2. Create app
3. Run on MEDIUM node (computationally intensive)
4. Validate MIRDeep2 outputs
5. Check novel miRNA predictions
