STATUS: PASSED
DATE: 2025-09-30
TESTER: david40962

APP: chipseq-with-input-control
PIPELINE: nf-core/chipseq v2.0.0
NODE SIZE: XSMALL (4 CPUs, 15GB RAM)

FINAL TEST:
- Job ID: 4490
- Status: COMPLETED
- Runtime: 37 minutes 19 seconds
- Samples: 6 (4 ChIP + 2 Input controls)
- Genome: R64-1-1 (Yeast)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Pipeline successfully processes ChIP-seq with input controls
2. MACS2 peak calling works correctly with ChIP vs Input comparison
3. All QC steps completed successfully
4. Outputs generated correctly in stash storage

CONFIGURATION FIX:
- Original command had --macs_gsize 2.7e9 (caused type error)
- Fixed command uses --read_length 50 (auto-calculates genome size)
- Resulted genome size: 11,624,332 bp

ISSUES RESOLVED:
- Test 1-2: Fixed macs_gsize parameter type error
- Test 3: Added read_length parameter requirement
- Test 4: SUCCESSFUL with corrected parameters

MINOR ISSUES (Non-critical):
- PRESEQ_LCEXTRAP fails on test data (expected, ignored by pipeline)
- Does not affect peak calling or main analysis

RECOMMENDATION: APPROVED for production use
