## Test Data Information

**Source**: https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/proteinfold

**Samplesheet**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/proteinfold/testdata/samplesheet/v1.2/samplesheet.csv`

**Test Proteins**:

## Attempt 1 - 2025-09-30

**Date/Time**: 2025-09-30 01:55 AM

**Configuration**:
- Node Size: XSMALL (4 CPUs, 15GB RAM, GPU enabled)
- Command: `nextflow run nf-core/proteinfold --input ${input} --outdir ${output} --mode alphafold2 --alphafold2_model_preset monomer_ptm --use_gpu true --full_dbs false --num_recycle 3 -r 1.2.0 -c /etc/mpi/nextflow.camber.config -profile singularity`
- Test Data: nf-core test samplesheet with 2 proteins

**Execution**:
```bash
camber app create --file app.json
camber app run proteinfold-single-protein-alphafold2 \
  --input input="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/proteinfold/testdata/samplesheet/v1.2/samplesheet.csv" \

## Next Steps

If this use case is working:
- [ ] Implement Use Case 2: Protein Complex (Multimer)
- [ ] Implement Use Case 3: Batch Prediction
- [ ] Test with larger proteins
- [ ] Test with custom sequences
- [ ] Document optimal resource allocation per protein size

If this use case failed:
- [ ] Review proteinfold pipeline documentation
- [ ] Check nf-core Slack for similar issues
- [ ] Consider alternative modes (ColabFold, ESMFold)
- [ ] Document blockers for future resolution
