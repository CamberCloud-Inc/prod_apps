## Issue: Jobs Failing / Not Visible

### Problem Diagnosis

You mentioned "most things have failed" in your dashboard. Here's what happened:

**Batch 1 Apps - WRONG ACCOUNT** ❌
- riboseq-translation-efficiency
- riboseq-stress-response
- circrna-cancer-biomarkers
- circrna-annotation
- nascent-transcription-dynamics
- nascent-enhancer-activity
- slamseq-rna-stability

**Created under**: ivannovikau32295788 (WRONG!)
**Result**: You can't see these apps or any jobs from them
**Test Jobs**: 4521, 4523, 4525, 4526, 4527 - all under wrong account

## Apps Successfully Under Your Account (david40962)

### ✅ Batch 2: Advanced Genomics (7 apps - DEPLOYED BUT UNTESTED)

Created at 2025-10-01 00:05-00:09 under correct account:

1. **pacvar-structural-variants** - Created 00:05:36
2. **pacvar-repeat-expansions** - Created 00:05:37
3. **oncoanalyser-tumor-normal** - Created 00:07:35
4. **oncoanalyser-targeted-panel** - Created 00:07:36
5. **oncoanalyser-comprehensive** - Created 00:07:37
6. **raredisease-diagnostic-wgs** - Created 00:09:16
7. **raredisease-family-trio** - Created 00:09:17

**Status**: ✅ Apps exist and are visible in your account
**Problem**: ⚠️ **NOT TESTED YET** - just created, no validation

---

## What Worked Previously

According to your dashboard, **circdna-detection** was the last successful job. This was from before this session.

---

## What I've Actually Done This Session

### ✅ Completed:
1. **Documented Batch 1 testing results** in BATCH_1_TESTING_LOG.md
2. **Fixed nascent apps** - added missing assay_type parameter
3. **Created all 7 Batch 2 apps** under correct account
4. **Verified pipelines** - all DSL2, stable versions
5. **Created progress tracking** - IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md

### ❌ Not Done:
1. **Testing Batch 2 apps** - no test jobs run yet
2. **Fixing Batch 1 account issue** - apps stuck under wrong account
3. **Validating any apps work** - only circdna worked before

---

## Current State Summary

**Total Apps Created**: 52 (from 24 pipelines)

**By Account**:
- ❌ Wrong account (ivannovikau32295788): 7 Batch 1 apps (not usable by you)
- ✅ Your account (david40962): 7 Batch 2 apps (untested)
- ✅ Previous session: ~38 apps (1 tested: circdna)

**Testing Status**:
- ✅ Tested and working: circdna-detection (1 app)
- ⚠️ Deployed but untested: Batch 2 (7 apps)
- ❌ Under wrong account: Batch 1 (7 apps)
- ❓ Previous apps: Unknown test status

---

## Recommended Next Steps

**Option 1: Test Batch 2 Apps**
- Run test jobs for pacvar, oncoanalyser, raredisease
- Validate they work before continuing

**Option 2: Focus on Quality Over Quantity**
- Stop creating new apps
- Test and validate existing apps
- Fix broken ones

**Option 3: Clean Slate**
- Document what exists
- Create testing strategy
- Systematic validation of all apps

---

## Key Lessons

1. **Account matters** - Always verify API key before deploying
2. **Testing is critical** - App creation ≠ working app
3. **Quality > Quantity** - Better to have 10 working apps than 50 broken ones
4. **Documentation helps** - Need clear testing procedures

---

**What should I do next?**
- Continue creating more apps (Batch 3+)?
- Test existing Batch 2 apps?
- Something else?
