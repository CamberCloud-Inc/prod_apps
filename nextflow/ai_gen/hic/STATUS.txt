⚠️ Working with Minor Issues

Core Hi-C Analysis: FUNCTIONAL
MultiQC Reporting: FAILED

Date: 2025-09-30
Tests: 4/5 attempts
Pipeline Version: nf-core/hic 2.1.0

SUMMARY:
The nf-core/hic pipeline successfully completes all core Hi-C analysis steps including:
- Read alignment (Bowtie2)
- Read trimming
- Valid interaction pair detection
- Contact matrix generation
- Statistics calculation

ISSUE:
- MultiQC aggregation step consistently fails (exit status 1)
- Does not prevent core analysis from completing
- Individual QC files still generated

IMPACT:
- Users get all essential Hi-C analysis outputs
- Missing: Consolidated HTML QC report
- Workaround: Individual QC metrics available in output

RECOMMENDATION:
- Usable for production Hi-C analysis
- Users should be aware of missing MultiQC report
- Minimum SMALL node size for test data
- MEDIUM-LARGE recommended for production (200M+ reads)

NEXT STEPS:
- Investigate MultiQC version/container compatibility
- Consider adding --skip_multiqc parameter
- Update pipeline to newer version when available
