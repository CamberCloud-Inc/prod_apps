Status: Ready for Testing
App: chipseq-histone-broad
Created: 2025-09-30

Configuration:
- Command: nextflow run nf-core/chipseq --input ${input} --outdir ${outdir} --genome ${genome} --macs_gsize 2.7e9 --broad_cutoff 0.1 -r 2.0.0 -profile singularity
- Parameters: 3 (input, outdir, genome)
- Hardcoded: macs_gsize=2.7e9, broad_cutoff=0.1
- Peak calling: Broad peaks optimized for histone modifications

Biology:
- Target: Histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3)
- Users: Epigenetics researchers studying chromatin states
- Application: Map diffuse chromatin marks across the genome

Files:
- app.json: Created and configured
- samplesheet.csv: Downloaded from nf-core/test-datasets
- README.md: Exists (from previous implementation)
- TESTING_LOG.md: Created
- STATUS.txt: This file

Next Steps:
- Test with camber commands
- Monitor job execution
- Document results in TESTING_LOG.md
- Commit to git after successful testing
