# Pipeline: differentialabundance

**Latest Version**: 1.5.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30
**Overall Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress

## Summary

The nf-core/differentialabundance pipeline performs differential abundance analysis on feature/observation matrices from various platforms including RNA-seq, proteomics, and microarray data. It supports multiple statistical methods (DESeq2, edgeR, limma) and generates comprehensive reports with interactive visualizations.

**Key Features**:
- Differential expression analysis for RNA-seq data
- Proteomics differential abundance (MaxQuant output)
- Microarray analysis (Affymetrix CEL files)
- Gene set enrichment analysis
- Interactive HTML reports and optional Shiny apps
- Supports complex experimental designs with multiple factors

## Use Cases Identified
