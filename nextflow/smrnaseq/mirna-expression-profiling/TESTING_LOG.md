# Testing Log: smrnaseq - miRNA Expression Profiling

## Test Configuration

**App**: smrnaseq-mirna-profiling
**Pipeline**: nf-core/smrnaseq v2.4.0
**Test Data**: nf-core test-datasets (8 human samples)
**Genome**: GRCh38 (will use from iGenomes)
**Species**: hsa (human)

## Configuration Notes

- Using nf-core official test data
- Single-end FASTQ files (typical for small RNA-seq)
- No custom config needed initially (using pipeline defaults)
- Species code must match reference genome
