# Testing Log: smrnaseq - Novel miRNA Discovery

## Test Configuration

**App**: smrnaseq-novel-discovery
**Pipeline**: nf-core/smrnaseq v2.4.0
**Test Data**: nf-core test-datasets (8 human samples)
**Genome**: GRCh38
**Species**: hsa (human)
**MIRDeep2**: Enabled (skip_mirdeep = false)

## Testing Status

ðŸ”² Not yet tested

---

## Attempt Log

Attempts will be documented here.

---

## Configuration Notes

- MIRDeep2 enabled for novel discovery
- May be slower than standard profiling
- Test data may not yield many novel discoveries (human is well-annotated)
- Expected: Focus on pipeline functionality rather than biological discovery

---

## Lessons Learned

Will be documented after testing.
