## Configuration Patterns That Work

Document successful patterns here:

**Resource Allocation**:
```groovy
// Example working config
process {
  withLabel:process_medium {
    cpus   = { 6     * task.attempt }
    memory = { 36.GB * task.attempt }
  }
}
```

**Key Parameters**:
- Parameter 1: Always set to X for this pipeline
- Parameter 2: Varies by use case (see individual apps)

## Lessons Learned
