❌ Failed - Reference Data Configuration Required

Pipeline: nf-core/raredisease v2.6.0
Implementation Date: 2025-09-30
Test Attempts: 2 / 5
Successful Tests: 0

Status: The pipeline has been researched, documented, and configured but cannot be successfully tested without staging extensive reference genome data (FASTA, intervals, dbSNP, gnomAD, VEP cache, etc.).

Deliverables Completed:
✅ Pipeline research and use case identification
✅ PIPELINE_STATUS.md - Comprehensive pipeline documentation
✅ USE_CASES.md - 9 prioritized use cases identified
✅ wgs-standard/app.json - App configuration for WGS rare disease analysis
✅ wgs-standard/README.md - User-facing documentation
✅ wgs-standard/test_samplesheet.csv - Test data configuration
✅ TESTING_LOG.md - Detailed testing attempts and findings

Blockers:
❌ Pipeline requires extensive reference data files that are not pre-staged on platform
❌ Profile conflicts between -profile test and automatic -profile k8s
❌ Test datasets are mitochondrial-focused, not suitable for WGS testing

Recommendations:
1. Create separate mitochondrial analysis app using --analysis_type mito
2. Request platform administrators to pre-stage standard reference genomes
3. Document reference data staging requirements for users
4. Consider this pipeline for future implementation when infrastructure supports it

See TESTING_LOG.md for detailed test results and analysis.
