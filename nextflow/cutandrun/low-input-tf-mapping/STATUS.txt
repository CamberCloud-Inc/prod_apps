STATUS: RUNNING - Test in Progress
Date: 2025-09-30
Tester: david40962

TESTING SUMMARY:
================
App Name: cutandrun-low-input-tf
Pipeline: nf-core/cutandrun v3.2.2

TEST RESULTS:
- Attempt 1 (Job 4477): RUNNING (started 2025-09-30 17:22:24Z)
  * Duration: 5+ minutes and still processing
  * Pipeline successfully initialized
  * Genome preparation completed
  * FASTQC and trimming in progress
  * Alignment stages launched

PIPELINE PROGRESS:
✅ Samplesheet validation
✅ Genome preparation (chromsizes, GTF to BED)
✅ iGenomes reference data staging (s3://ngi-igenomes)
✅ FASTQC process launched
✅ TrimGalore trimming started
⏳ Alignment and downstream analysis in progress

WORKING CONFIGURATION:
- Git clone approach: ✅ Working
- Config file distribution: ✅ Successful
- Remote URL samplesheet: ✅ Working correctly
- iGenomes access: ✅ S3 staging successful
- Resource allocation: ✅ XSMALL node handling test data

TEST PARAMETERS:
- Samplesheet: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/cutandrun/samplesheet_2_0/test-GSE145187-small.csv
- Genome: GRCh38
- Samples: H3K27me3 + IgG control
- Peak caller: SEACR only
- IgG control: Enabled
- Mitochondrial filtering: Enabled (chrM)
- Duplicate removal: Enabled
- Node size: XSMALL (4 CPUs, 15GB RAM)

SUCCESS FACTORS:
1. Git clone successfully fetches platform-constrained-config.config
2. Working directory maintained at execution location
3. Output directory created as subfolder (./cutandrun-lowinput-test-results)
4. All pipeline dependencies accessible
5. Config files properly loaded

COMMAND STRUCTURE (WORKING):
```bash
mkdir -p ${outputDir} && cd ${outputDir} &&
rm -rf prod_apps &&
git clone https://github.com/CamberCloud-Inc/prod_apps.git &&
cp prod_apps/nextflow/cutandrun/low-input-tf-mapping/platform-constrained-config.config ./ &&
rm -rf prod_apps &&
nextflow run nf-core/cutandrun -r 3.2.2 ...
```

NOTES:
- This command structure works because nextflow is executed AFTER changing to output directory
- The URL samplesheet is validated by nextflow before processing
- Config file is present in execution directory when nextflow runs
- This app can serve as template for fixing histone-modifications app

RECOMMENDATION:
- Wait for full completion to verify end-to-end success
- If successful, use this pattern for other CUT&RUN apps
- Document this working pattern for future app development

ESTIMATED COMPLETION:
- XSMALL node with test data: ~10-20 minutes total
- Job still running after 5 minutes - normal for alignment steps

NEXT STEPS:
- Monitor job completion
- Verify output files generated correctly
- Check MultiQC report
- Validate peak calling results
- Update status to SUCCESS or document any issues

FILES:
- app.json: Working configuration
- platform-constrained-config.config: Successfully loaded
