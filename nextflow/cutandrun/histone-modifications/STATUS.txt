STATUS: FAILED - Needs Fix
Date: 2025-09-30
Tester: david40962

TESTING SUMMARY:
================
App Name: cutandrun-histone-modifications
Pipeline: nf-core/cutandrun v3.2.2

TEST RESULTS:
- Attempt 1 (Job 4474): FAILED - Config file not found (22s)
- Attempt 2 (Job 4485): FAILED - Input URL validation failed after directory change (27s)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. Config file distribution - git clone approach partially works but needs refinement
2. Directory change affects URL validation - working directory context matters
3. Command structure needs revision to handle both config distribution and input validation

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Maintain working directory at /home/camber instead of cd-ing to output directory
2. Copy config file to /home/camber before nextflow execution
3. Use --outdir parameter with full path or relative path from /home/camber
4. Consider pre-downloading samplesheet or ensuring URL validation happens before directory changes

BLOCKING ISSUES:
- Cannot validate remote URLs after changing to output directory
- nf-core/cutandrun pipeline strict about input file existence

NEXT STEPS:
- Revise command structure to avoid directory change before nextflow execution
- Test with config in /home/camber and outdir as parameter value
- Verify with test data before production release

FILES MODIFIED:
- app.json: Updated to include git clone for config distribution

REQUIRES: Code fix and retest
