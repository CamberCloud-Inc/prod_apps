# Pipeline: nf-core/taxprofiler

**Latest Version**: 1.2.3
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30
**Overall Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress

## Summary

nf-core/taxprofiler is a bioinformatics pipeline for taxonomic classification and profiling of shotgun short- and long-read metagenomic data. It enables highly parallelized taxonomic profiling across multiple classifiers and databases simultaneously, producing standardized output tables for immediate cross-comparison of results between tools.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-tool taxonomic profiling (Kraken2, MetaPhlAn, mOTUs, Centrifuge, Kaiju, etc.)
- Support for both Illumina short-reads and Nanopore long-reads
- Read preprocessing (adapter trimming, host removal, complexity filtering)
- Standardized outputs via TAXPASTA for cross-tool comparison
- Multiple database support per tool

**Biological Applications**:
- Microbiome composition analysis
- Pathogen detection and surveillance
- Environmental metagenomics
- Clinical metagenomics
- Ancient DNA analysis

## Use Cases Identified

1. **Microbiome Profiling (Kraken2)** - P0 (HIGHEST PRIORITY) - ðŸ”„ In Progress
   - Fast taxonomic classification for gut/environmental microbiomes
   - Most common use case for researchers

2. **Clinical Pathogen Detection** - P0 - ðŸ”² Not Started
   - Rapid identification of pathogens in clinical samples
   - Critical for diagnostic applications

3. **Comprehensive Multi-Tool Profiling** - P1 - ðŸ”² Not Started
   - Compare results across multiple profilers
   - Research validation and method comparison

## Implementation Progress

- [x] Research phase complete
- [x] Use cases defined
- [x] Pipeline documentation reviewed
- [ ] App 1: Microbiome Profiling (Kraken2) - ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] App 2: Clinical Pathogen Detection - ðŸ”² Pending
- [ ] App 3: Multi-Tool Profiling - ðŸ”² Pending

## Issues Encountered

*None yet - implementation just starting*

## Key Considerations

### Database Requirements
- taxprofiler requires pre-built databases for each profiler
- Databases must be provided via a database sheet CSV
- This is a significant consideration - may need to provide test databases or instructions

### Resource Requirements
- Varies by profiler and database size
- Kraken2 with standard database: MEDIUM to LARGE node
- MetaPhlAn: SMALL to MEDIUM node
- Multiple profilers in parallel: LARGE to XLARGE node

## Success Metrics

- 0/3 apps working
- 0/3 apps tested successfully
- Testing in progress

## Next Steps

1. Identify nf-core test data for taxprofiler
2. Create Kraken2 microbiome profiling app
3. Test with XSMALL node size initially
4. Document all testing attempts
