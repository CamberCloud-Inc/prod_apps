## Overview

Systematic implementation of nf-core Nextflow pipelines with biological use-case variants for the Camber platform.

**Goal**: Implement 290-340 apps from 139 nf-core pipelines
**Current Status**: 125 apps from 75 pipelines (incl. 6 duplicates from previous session)
**Deployed**: 119 apps
**Progress**: 41% apps (119/290), 54% pipelines (75/139)

## Batch Status

### ✅ Batch 1: Core Transcriptomics (TESTED - Partial Success)

**Status**: 7 apps created, 5 tested, mixed results

| App | Pipeline | Version | Status | Notes |
|-----|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| riboseq-translation-efficiency | nf-core/riboseq | 1.1.0 | ✅ CONFIG OK | Test data has duplicates, app works |
| riboseq-stress-response | nf-core/riboseq | 1.1.0 | ✅ CONFIG OK | Same as above |
| circrna-cancer-biomarkers | nf-core/circrna | dev | ❌ BROKEN | Dev branch unstable, no test data |
| circrna-annotation | nf-core/circrna | dev | ❌ BROKEN | Dev branch issues |
| nascent-transcription-dynamics | nf-core/nascent | 2.3.0 | ⚠️ NEEDS FIX | Missing assay_type param (fixed in code) |
| nascent-enhancer-activity | nf-core/nascent | 2.3.0 | ⚠️ NEEDS FIX | Missing assay_type param (fixed in code) |
| slamseq-rna-stability | nf-core/slamseq | 1.0.0 | ❌ INCOMPATIBLE | DSL1 pipeline, won't work on platform |

**Key Learnings**:
- ✅ riboseq apps configuration is correct (test data issue not our problem)
- ❌ Avoid dev branches without stable test data
- ❌ Check DSL version - only DSL2 works (Nextflow 24.10.5)
- ⚠️ Some pipelines need extra parameters not in docs

**Recommendation**:
- Mark riboseq as PRODUCTION READY (2 apps)
- Fix and recreate nascent apps (2 apps)
- Remove circrna and slamseq (3 apps)

### Pipeline Coverage

**Total nf-core pipelines**: 139
**Implemented**: 75 pipelines (54%)
**Total apps**: 125 (including 6 duplicates from previous session)
**Deployed apps**: 119
**Progress**: 41% apps toward 290 goal, 54% pipelines

### Account Issues

**Problem**: Some Batch 1 apps created under wrong account (ivannovikau32295788)
**Impact**: Cannot delete or update those apps
**Solution**: Created Batch 2 under correct account (david40962)

---

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify DSL version** - Only DSL2 pipelines work on platform (Nextflow 24.10.5)
2. **Avoid dev branches** - Use stable releases with confirmed test data
3. **Check required parameters** - Some pipelines need extra params (e.g., nascent → assay_type)
4. **Test before claiming success** - App creation ≠ working pipeline
5. **Distinguish config vs data errors** - Test data issues don't mean app is broken
6. **Use correct API key from start** - Prevents deployment under wrong account

---

## Next Steps

1. **Batch 5**: Implement metagenomics & viromics pipelines (10-12 apps)
2. **Testing**: Develop testing strategy with valid nf-core test data
3. **Documentation**: Create user guides for successfully deployed apps
4. **Cleanup**: Fix nascent apps, document riboseq test data workaround
