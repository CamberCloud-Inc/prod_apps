  "description": "Fetches supplementary information for a research paper using its DOI. Downloads supplementary files and returns a research log of the process.",
  "content": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>Fetches supplementary materials and files associated with a research paper using its DOI (Digital Object Identifier). Automatically identifies and downloads supplementary datasets, additional figures, extended methods, code, and other supporting materials published alongside the main article.</p><h3>Input Parameters</h3><ul><li><strong>doi</strong> (required): Digital Object Identifier of the research paper (e.g., \"10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2\")</li></ul><h3>Input Format</h3><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"doi\": \"10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2\"\n}</code></pre><h3>Biological Use Case</h3><p>Critical for accessing the complete dataset and materials associated with published research. Use cases include: downloading supplementary datasets for reanalysis, obtaining detailed methods and protocols, accessing additional figures and extended data, retrieving source code and analysis scripts, downloading sequence data and alignments, and gathering materials for reproducibility studies. Supplementary information often contains essential details not included in the main manuscript, such as complete gene lists, full experimental protocols, raw data tables, and statistical analyses.</p><h3>Output</h3><p>Returns downloaded supplementary files in the output directory along with a summary text file (supplementary_info.txt) documenting the research log of what was found and downloaded. All supplementary materials are saved with descriptive filenames.</p><h3>Category</h3><p>literature</p>",
